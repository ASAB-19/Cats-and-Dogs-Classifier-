# Cats-and-Dogs-Classifier-
I built an image classifier that can distinguish between cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained on over 2,000 images and deployed with Streamlit, allowing users to upload their own photos from any device and receive instant predictions. The model sometimes misclassifies unusual or out-of-distribution images (e.g., animal memes or very young puppies), which is expected given the small dataset and simple CNN architecture
